This was my first attempt at joining the three scripts of the 1st version into one.

The result is functional, though still not very elegant and still requiring a lot of editing from whoever decided to actually use it. I leave it here for the curious humans that might stumble upon this madness.

It works the same way as v0.1 but it's just one scripts with different options. You can read the [original README](/old_versions/v0.1) there for some more info.
